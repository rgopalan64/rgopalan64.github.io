This is an R Markdown document, created specifically for the Coursera course PRACTICAL MACHINE LEARNING.  The purpose of this markdown document is to illustrate SOME of the analyses that were conducted during the building of the machine learning algorithm.  The RANDOM FOREST algorithm gave the best predictive accuracy and was able to solve all twenty TEST cases correctly.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
